#Core Tasks and Sequences of Agent

(E.g. For every upcomming slaes meeting on my Google Calendar, search the prospect in Perplexity and return a concise summary in the #Sales-Prep slack channel)

#Tools Agent Should Use

(E.g. Slack, Salesforce, Google Calendar, Perplexity)

#Preventative Rules Agent to Follow

(E.g. Before sending POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, confirm the request body and parameters with me.)

# Roadmap

- **Test Core Tools:** Add agents to validate the core functionalities of MS365 and Slack integrations.
- **Expand Test Coverage:** Build additional test agents to ensure broad reliability.
- **Create Evaluation Module:** Develop a module to autonomously test for and handle edge cases before deployment.
- **Build Deployment Module:** Create a streamlined module to prepare agents for deployment to LangGraph.
