# The Agent Development Playbook

This playbook provides a disciplined Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for creating robust, reliable, and effective LangGraph agents. It should be treated as the canonical sequence for every new agent project to ensure a high-quality outcome on the first try.

---

### Phase 0: Discovery & Requirements

*Goal: Ask first, code later. Fully understand the problem before designing the solution.*

1.  **Define Success Criteria:** Work with the stakeholder (e.g., the user, a project manager) to define what a "good" response looks like. Capture measurable metrics like latency, output format (e.g., JSON, markdown), completeness, and tone.
2.  **Gather Edge Cases:** Collect 2-3 difficult, adversarial, or out-of-scope examples. The agent must handle these gracefully.
3.  **Establish Constraints:** Document all rules and limitations. This includes PII handling, knowledge cut-offs, forbidden tools, or required data sources.

**Deliverable:** A simple Q&A document summarizing the above points.

### Phase 1: Agent Specification

*Goal: Create a clear blueprint for each agent *before* writing code.*

For each agent or sub-agent in your system, create a formal specification sheet.

| Field | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role & Objective** | "An expert financial researcher who transforms broad user topics into 3-5 specific, high-quality search queries." |
| **Input/Output** | A JSON schema defining the expected input and output, plus 1-2 worked examples. |
| **Tools & Usage** | A list of allowed tools and the specific conditions under which they should be used. (e.g., `TavilySearchTool` for financial news). |
| **Termination** | Conditions for when the agent should stop. (e.g., "Stop when a final answer is generated" or "Stop after 2 failed tool calls"). |
| **Fallback / Escalation**| What to do on failure. (e.g., "If search fails, ask the user to refine their query"). |

**Deliverable:** A packet of specification sheets for all agents, reviewed and approved.

---

### Phase 2: System Architecture

*Goal: Choose the right structure for the job.*

1.  **Graph Topology:** Consciously choose the lightest graph pattern that meets the requirements.
    *   **Simple Pipeline:** For sequential, deterministic tasks (e.g., `Planner -> Researcher -> Analyst`).
    *   **Router / Orchestrator:** For complex workflows that require dynamically choosing the next step or tool.
    *   **Supervisor Sub-graph:** For tasks requiring reflection, debate, or self-correction loops.
2.  **Memory Design:** Design the memory system in layers.
    *   **Working Memory:** Short-term history for the current conversational turn (e.g., `MessagesState`).
    *   **Task Memory:** Facts and context relevant to the current session (e.g., a "scratchpad" in the state `TypedDict`).
    *   **Long-Term Memory:** User profiles, preferences, or global knowledge, often in an external database.

**Deliverable:** A diagram of the graph topology and a definition of the agent's state schema.

### Phase 3: Implementation & Observability

*Goal: Build the agent and instrument it for debugging and monitoring.*

1.  **Build the Graph:** Implement the agents and graph structure defined in the previous phases.
2.  **Add Observability Hooks**:
    -   **LangSmith Tracing**: Instrument your agent with LangSmith from the start. This is not optional for production-grade monitoring. Use clear, descriptive names for your nodes and runs to make traces easy to read and filter.
    -   **Debug Logging**: Before relying on full tracing, add simple `print()` statements to each node in your graph. Logging the inputs and outputs of each step is the fastest way to debug the agent's internal data flow and verify that each component is behaving as expected.
3.  **Create an Evaluation Harness:**
    *   Add the edge cases from Phase 0 to a LangSmith `Dataset`.
    *   Create evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-judge, custom logic) to score your agent's performance on this dataset.

**Deliverable:** A runnable agent integrated with LangSmith and a core evaluation dataset.

### Phase 4: Production Readiness

*Goal: Make the agent robust, safe, and deployable.*

1.  **Error Handling:** Wrap tool calls and LLM invocations in `try...except` blocks. Implement retries for transient errors and fallbacks for critical failures.
2.  **Safety & Policy:** Implement safety guardrails, such as a system prompt that defines the agent's ethical boundaries or rules (e.g., "Do not give medical advice").
3.  **Versioning:** Store your prompts, tool configurations, and agent definitions in version control (e.g., Git).

**Deliverable:** A production-hardened agent ready for deployment.
