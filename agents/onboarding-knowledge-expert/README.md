## üîß Customization

### Adding Knowledge Documents
Edit `knowledge_tools.py` to add new documents:
```python
KNOWLEDGE_BASE["policies"]["new_policy"] = {
    "title": "New Policy Title",
    "content": "Policy content...",
    "source_url": "https://company.notion.so/new-policy",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
}
```

### Customizing Onboarding Journeys
Modify `onboarding_tools.py` templates:
```python
ONBOARDING_TEMPLATES["custom_30_day"] = {
    "duration_days": 30,
    "tasks": [
        {
            "day": 1,
            "task_id": "custom_welcome",
            "title": "Custom Welcome",
            "action_type": "automated_message"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Adding New Service Routes
Extend service request routing in `knowledge_tools.py`:
```python
service_routes["new_service"] = {
    "form_url": "https://company.form.com",
    "slack_channel": "#new-service",
    "description": "Service description"
}
```

## üéØ Production Deployment

### Memory Store Configuration
For production, replace in-memory storage with persistent store:
```python
# In agent.py, configure LangGraph memory
from langgraph.store.postgres import PostgresStore
store = PostgresStore(connection_string="postgresql://...")
```

### Slack App Setup
1. Create Slack app with bot permissions
2. Subscribe to message events
3. Install to workspace
4. Configure slash commands (optional)

### Vector Database (RAG)
For large knowledge bases, implement vector search:
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Replace keyword search with semantic search
vectorstore = Chroma(
    embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    persist_directory="./knowledge_db"
)
```

### Scheduling Service
Implement proper task scheduling:
```python
# Use Celery, Airflow, or cloud scheduler
from celery import Celery
app = Celery('onboarding_scheduler')

@app.task
def send_scheduled_onboarding_message(user_id, message_template):
    # Execute scheduled onboarding task
    pass
```
